                            Everyday, we are witnessing millions of fascinating phenomena on our planet - from the complex mechanism of the flapping wings of a bee to the powerful ocean currents helping redistributing warmth around the world. Although, such sensations can be quite different in their kind, their systems can often be related.

                                In recent years, deep learning has opened countless research opportunities across many different disciplines. At present, visualization is mainly applied to explore and explain neural networks. Its counterpart–the application of deep learning to visualization problems–requires us to share data more openly in order to enable more scientists to engage in data-driven research. In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size. Using our public fluid data set, we trained deep convolutional neural networks in order to set a benchmark for an improved post-hoc Lagrangian fluid flow analysis. In in-situ settings, flow maps are exported and interpolated in order to assess the transport characteristics of time-dependent fluids. Using deep learning, we improve the accuracy of flow map interpolations, allowing a more precise flow analysis at a reduced memory IO footprint.

                                Segmentation through Deep Learning methods on point cloud data has been successfully applied on human made objects previously. Natural structures on the other hand have been coming short due to their complex geometry. In this work we tackled different challenges and developed the whole project from scratch - from the data generation to implementing different neural network architectures and their evaluations on our data set. Since this work was a collaboration between ASL at ETH Zurich and DRZ (Disney Research Zurich) the project is under NDA and I can not get into details, unfortunately.

                                From simple shading techniques over subdivision of surfaces, surface reconstruction, mesh parametrization and deformation to face warping these lectures cover them all. It is a heavy C++ coding course with a final project, where landmark selection, rigid transformation, warping and face blending had to be implemented. Some problems needed algorithms like Moving Least Squares, and solving of linear optimization problems with constraints.

The problem sets and the final project needed to be written in C++. For the final project I have implemented an analytical IK solver and gait controller for a hexapod to make it able to walk, turn around and be controlled by the user.

                                Physically-based rendering deceive people to tell synthetic images from real ones apart. Here ones learns how to do so. Specifically, physics of light and its computation on different material surfaces is taught. In a nutshell, light rays are traced from the light source where they bounce on objects and the final color is summed up into a single pixel. Algorithms like Monte-Carlo Sampling are essential to render the image within an acceptable time.

                        Hi, I'm Jakob and I'm pleased to e-meet you! If you are interested in doing a project together - be it in science or shooting a video - feel free to write me!

                        The way
                    </div>
                    <div class="credo">
                        Observe, Ponder & Create. <br> <br>
                        
                        This is the credo I follow for the things I'm passionate about, which lie mostly between the intersection of creativity and technology. 
                        <br> <br>
                        In general, I'm a big fan of simplicity and I'm always down to learn something new or expand my knowledge within a specific topic. Thus, I'm quite curious about a lot of things, so I break it down a little. 
                        <br>
                        In terms of science and besides physics and mathematics, I'm mostly stoked about Computer Graphics and Vision, Robotics and Optimization.
                        <br>
                        Concerning creativity I have a weak spot for aesthetics and design. Mostly I live it out by acting, cooking or doing pottery. But I also like to shoot photos or videos. 
                        <br>
                        Besides all of this, I work out outdoors in nature once a day and enjoy reading and writing on a regular basis. Of course I also love to spend some time and laugh with my family, friends or company.
